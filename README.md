## Introduction

The four functions in the main directory of this repository generate the four plots required in this assignment.

If you would like to view each plot they are in this folder and are called plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png and plot4.png.

### Testing the code

If you would like to test the code, simply clone this directory. Then set the working directory as the main directory of the folder.
Run the following commands in R:

To generate plot1:

``` {R}
source("plot1.R")
```
To generate plot2:

``` {R}
source("plot2.R")
```
To generate plot3:

``` {R}
source("plot3.R")
```
To generate plot4:

``` {R}
source("plot4.R")
```

This should generate the needed plots and will save each plot in the main directory, for example if you run source("plot1.R"), it will generate a file called plot1.png in your main directory.
