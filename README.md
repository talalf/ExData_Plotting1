## Introduction

The four functions in the main directory of this repository generate the four plots required in this assignment.

If you would like to view each plot they are in this folder and are called plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R.

### Testing the code

If you would like to test the code, simply clone this directory. Then set the working directory as the main directory of the folder.
Run the following command in R:

``` {R}
source("plot1.R")
```

This should generate the needed plots.
